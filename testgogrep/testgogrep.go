  REVISION HISTORY
  ----------------
  20 Mar 20 -- Made comparisons case insensitive.  And decided to make this cgrepi.go.
                 And then I figured I could not improve performance by using more packages.
                 But I can change the side effect of displaying altered case.
  21 Mar 20 -- Now called testgogrep, to test the separate module I wrote.  So most of the original code has been moved to gogrep.
                 It works, but is not helpful.  I had to rethink the problem and anack is the result.  And this works.
