## gocode
All of my go code til now

1. sha -- easier way for me to validate d/l file hashes that works the same on linux and windows.
1. rpn, rpn2, rpng -- RPN style calculator like the HP-25 that I used while in college.  Has CLI.

1. rpntcell -- Same RPN style calculator but written to use tcell.
1. vlc -- Intended to shuffle the individual files in a vlc .xspf file.  Has CLI.
1. cal -- Simple CLI program that creates a file for paper output, a year on a page, and a 2nd file to import into Excel to be used to make a schedule.

1. solve -- Linear algebra equation solver.  Rather primitive but works for me.
1. showutf8, toascii, utf8toascii, trimtoascii -- show or convert utf8 to straight ascii codepoints.
                                                  utf8toascii can also convert line endings.
1. primes, primes2, makeprimesslice -- does prime factoring.

All the other files were either used in testing or are support files for the above programs.
