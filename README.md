# gocode
All of my go code til now

1. comparehashes -- easier way for me to validate d/l file hashes that works the same on linux and windows.
1. rpng -- RPN style calculator like the HP-25 that I used while in college.  Has CLI.
1. rpnterm -- Same RPN style calculator but written to use termbox-go.
1. vlc -- Intended to shuffle the individual files in a vlc .xspf file.  Has CLI.
1. cal -- Simple CLI program that creates a file for paper output, a year on a page, and a 2nd file to import into Excel to be used to make a schedule.

All the other files were either used in testing or are support files for the above programs.
